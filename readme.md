This is a music mod that brings the excitement of Converting/Recruiting Digimon to life by randomizing classic anime-inspired, vocalless PS1 tracks from **Digimon Rumble Arena** for the Digimon Conversion in Digimon Story Time Stranger.

**Key Features:**

  * **Classic Anime-inspired Soundtrack:** Replaces convert tracks with iconic, instrumental themes from *Digimon Rumble Arena*—no vocals, pure nostalgia.
  * **Randomized Tracks:** Each Convert event can play one of several alternative tracks, keeping the experience fresh and unpredictable.
  * **Integrated SFX:** Each track includes sound effects from classic Digimon Story games and Digimon World 1, mainly Digimon Story DS, to ensure the digivolution sequence remains impactful even with new music.
  * **Smooth Reverb Ending:** Every track features a custom reverb ending for seamless transitions, making the music feel natural as you play.

## **Randomized Digimon Convert Tracks**

Tracks are organized by cue, each representing a Convert sequence. For each cue, the following tracks are randomized:

### **Standard Digimon Conversion**

- **Butterfly**  
  *Preview: [Digimon Rumble Arena Butterfly (Vocalless PS1 Instrumental)](https://youtu.be/GPKJklZQ2Wk?si=B2v6zFrQOrBcCFm_)*

- **Target**

- **Slash!**

### **Short Digimon Conversion**

- **Butterfly (Short)**  
- **Target (Short)**  
- **Slash! (Short)**  

### **Important Note:**
```
Every Digimon Conversion sequence now features fully randomized music—each transformation will play a different track from the available pool, making every moment unique. If you skip the Standard Digivolution animation, the mod instantly switches to a randomly selected Short Digimon Conversion track for a seamless experience.

For example: If "Butterfly" is playing during Standard Digimon Conversion and you skip the animation, the mod will immediately choose and play one of the three Short Conversion tracks at random, ensuring the music always fits the action.
